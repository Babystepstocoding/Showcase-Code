# Showcase-Code
This is a portfolio repository of projects I'm proud of. Each folder denotes a key concept that projects within are intended to demonstrate or reinforce. Projects are not necessarily application ready or perfectly cleaned, they are a reflection of code I am proud of.

## About Me
I am a 5th year Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering student at the University of Connecticut. My focus is primarily on the marriage of computation with engineering design, especially in the realm of engineering applications of Machine Learning and Finite Element Analysis. In my free time, you can usually find me rehearsing for one of the University's instrumental ensembles
